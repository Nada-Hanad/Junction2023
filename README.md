# The Legend of Evexia

The Legend of Evexia is a pirate-themed app that helps you improve your mood, be active, and have fun!

## Overview

The Legend of Evexia is a three-tiered application consisting of a front end, backend, and models.

## Front End

The front end of the app provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend and models. Users can create their own pirate avatar, explore the land of Evexia, face challenges, and unlock new treasures.

## Backend

The backend of the app provides the functionality for tracking user activity and progress, providing personalized challenges and rewards, and managing user data.

## Game

## Models

The Legend of Evexia app uses a machine learning model to predict user emotions. The model is a random forest classifier, which is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions.

- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Fearful
- Neutral

The model is used to provide users with personalized challenges and rewards based on their emotional state. For example, if the model detects that a user is feeling stressed, it might challenge them to go for a walk or do some deep breathing exercises. If the user completes the challenge, they will be rewarded with coins or other treasures.
